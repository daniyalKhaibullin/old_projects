# old_projects
A repository with all the Python, JavaScript/HTML/CSS projects that I've made over the past couple of years (either as a school project, for fun, or due to boredom).

Over the last few years, I've gotten more interested into using python and javascript for far more complicated, interesting, and fun tasks other than using it for coming up with algorithms for some abstract problem solving, or using a plain simple HTML/CSS mashup with javascript to do create a boring projects like building a calculator, or a digital clock.

Thus, this repository serves as a memory capsule of all the projects I've done with Python and Javascript from the latest that I could find to the most recent ones that I'm doing still to this day.
